        The red deer (Cervus elaphus) is one of the largest deer species. A male red deer is called a stag or hart, and
        a female is called a doe or hind. The red deer inhabits most of Europe, the Caucasus Mountains region, Anatolia,
        Iran, and parts of western Asia. It also inhabits the Atlas Mountains of Northern Africa; being the only living
        species of deer to inhabit Africa. Red deer have been introduced to other areas, including Australia, New
        Zealand, the United States, Canada, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Argentina. In many parts of the world, the meat
        (venison) from red deer is used as a food source.
