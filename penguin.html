        Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the family Spheniscidae of the order Sphenisciformes. They
        live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, is found north of
        the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and
        flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch
        with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip
        slippery prey.
